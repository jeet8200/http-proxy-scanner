    Create ipranges.txt in the same folder

    Add Iranian IP ranges (for other places change the code ) - (one per line), for example:
    text

    5.52.0.0/14

#THINGS TO KNOW BEFOR USEING

Ethical and Legal Considerations

    Intended Use:
    The script is designed to scan for open HTTP proxies, especially in Iranian IP ranges.
    Note: Scanning IP ranges you do not own or have explicit permission to scan may violate laws or terms of service in many regions.
    You are responsible for ensuring your usage is legal and ethical.
    Network Load:
    With a default of 200 concurrent connections, this script can generate significant network traffic.
    Be careful: Running large-scale scans may trigger abuse detection or get your IP blacklisted.
